## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

*Lab-2:
This lab was really fun as it made you get creative with it. The coding part was the most fun part because in order to get the different variables for each subject you had to write the code a certain way in order for the sentence to make somewhat sense. For example, I coded something around the lines of “The dogs can all run into the computer”. Even though it sounds weird, they wanted to see if we could use plural nouns and verbs.

*Lab-5 Part 1:
Even though this lab was nothing too crazy it really got me thinking which I liked since I like to solve problems. The whole purpose of this lab was to find the area of a rectangle and to see how we could calculate it by using the width and length. The coding was a little difficult but not anything that I couldn’t save but since it involved using some numbers which was easier than I expected. In the end the code worked good and the final command would be “Enter the width/lenght of the rectangle” and everytime I would put certain numbers it would give me the correct answer.

*Lab-10 Part 2:
I actually enjoyed this lab alot since it was very informational and doing the coding was the most interesting part. The purpose of this lab was to get certain populations from different counties in California which I found very informational for me. The code itself was pretty straightforward as I had to find the population density which really made me think. Honestly this is probably the best and my favorite lab we’ve done all year and I wouldn’t mind doing it again since it's actually enjoyable.
